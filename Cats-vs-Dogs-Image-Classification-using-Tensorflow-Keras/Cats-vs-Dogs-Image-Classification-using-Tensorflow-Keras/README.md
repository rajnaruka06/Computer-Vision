#### Overview:
- The goal is to develop an ml model using deep learning which can correctly classify the pet in the image. 
- The dataset consists over 20,000 images of pets (Cats and Dogs)
- Link to the Dataset: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765

#### Approach:
- Develop a baseline model quickly.
- Look for areas of improvements. 
- Improve Model and perform preprocessings as needed.
